This Plugin makes it easy to add WooCommerce "Related Products" to single blog posts.

== Description ==

This Plugin makes it easy to add WooCommerce "Related Products" to individual blog posts.
Select from all your WooCommerce Products in the Wordpress "Add Post" admin screen to add them to the bottom of your post content. Inserts the selected product linked thumbnails to the bottom of your post content with css classes that make them easy to customize! This plugin is not meant to be an all encompassing WooCommerce Related Products Add-On.  It is just a simple solution to get WooCommerce products onto your blog posts

== Installation ==

Requirement: You must have the WooCommerce plugin installed with existing live products.

Simply activate this plugin from the Plugins page and a new admin meta box will appear in the Blog Post Editor Page.  There you can select any of your current WooCommerce plugins from a simple list.  After you publish the post the related products will appear directly after your post content in thumbnail size.  All of the HTML elements have classes assigned for easy style customization.  While the images do contain image alt and title tags, currently the option to include product titles or product prices is not included. If enough people want it, we can add it in a future version.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated the plugin, how come I can't see the "Related Products" section in the "Add New Posts" page? =

It may be hidden by default.  While on the Blog Post Editor Page, go to the top right under "Screen Options" and make sure "Related Products" box is selected.

= How do I customize the look of the related products? =

All of the HTML elements have unique classes for easy CSS customization. The width of each related product displayed in the blog post is determined by by the number of related products selected. So, for example if you select 5 products, they will each have a width of 20%. Unfortunately at this time, the related products are only displayed in thumbnail size, but we may add the option for larger sizes as well as custom CSS and responsive controls later.

= Does this feature work on Custom Post Types? =

This version has not been tested with custom post types.  Currently it is intended only to appear on normal wp posts with the post_type of "post"

= Does this feature work with Post Excerpts? =

Currently this feature is designed to display related products only on single posts, not archive or category pages.

== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot of the plugin listed on the Plugins admin page.
2. Screenshot of the Custom Meta Box that appears on the "Add New Post" page.  The products listed are for example purposes only.  Your product list will differ.
3. Screenshot showing an example of the related products will appear in a blog post.
